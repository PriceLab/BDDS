Staring with a fresh postgresql install, I start with
https://github.com/PriceLab/BDDS/blob/master/trenadb/src/initDB.sql

Next, either use the existing fimo database or make a fimo database (https://github.com/PriceLab/BDDS/blob/master/trenadb/fimo/create.sql)

I'll use the existing one:

to make new test wellington database:
psql -U databasemaker -h whovian
create database testWellington;
grant all privileges on database testWellington to trenatest;
set Role trenatest;

then /connect testwellington;
do https://github.com/PriceLab/BDDS/blob/master/trenadb/wellington/wholeBrain/createTables.sql

(first, a detour to get current version of R and manage dependancies needed for that: lesson learned. there's a Makevars file in ~/.R that can mess things up)


other misc notes:
to make read only:
\connect database
REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE on fimo_hg38 FROM public;
REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE on fimo_hg38 FROM ben;

to delete subset of data:
DELETE from hits where loc LIKE 'chr2:%';
delete from regions where loc LIKE 'chr2:%';

Merging 3 separate brain databases:
First, make two new brain databases: brain_hint and brain_wellington
Next, rename hits and regions tables to: hits_1, regions_1, hits_2, regions_2, etc.

psql brain_1_hint -U postgres -h whovian 
alter table hits rename to hits_1;
alter table regions rename to regions_1;
\q

(etc for wellington and other batches)

Next, make new tables in the brain_hint and brain_wellington databases for each hits and regions table from the other databases (TURNS OT NOT NEEDED)
psql brain_hint -U trena -h whovian
(recipe at https://github.com/PriceLab/BDDS/blob/master/footprints/testdb/dbInitialization/createTestWellington.sql for example)


Next, merge existing databases to that new one:
see
https://bytes.com/topic/postgresql/answers/421382-how-move-data-1-database-another

pg_dump -U trena -h whovian -d brain_1_hint -t hits_1 > hint_1_hits_1.sql
psql -U trena -h whovian -d brain_hint -f hint_1_hits_1.sql

(ERROR:  relation "hits_1" already exists -- likely because I made that)

similarly for regions...
BUT - 
psql:hint_1_regions_1.sql:4592604: ERROR:  multiple primary keys for table "regions_1" are not allowed

... seems okay - regions_1 table has 4592559 entries in each of the databases

and for wellington

Now that I've got the tables all in the same database, I can merge tables:
psql brain_hint -U trena -h whovian
insert into hits (select * from hits_1);
insert into hits (select * from hits_2);
insert into hits (select * from hits_3);
select count (*) from hits;
insert into regions (select * from regions_1);
insert into regions (select * from regions_2);
insert into regions (select * from regions_3);
select count (*) from regions;

drop table hits_1;
drop table hits_2;
drop table hits_3;
drop table regions_1;
drop table regions_2;
drop table regions_3;
\q

and the same for brain_wellington

then, make them read only.
