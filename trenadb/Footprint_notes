The scores each footprinting algorithm output are not well documented. As such, I will have notes here that function as a repository for what we can find regarding the scores

It appears Wellington uses the Neph math for calculation Footprint Occupancy Score (FOS). It does say what is the better score, but all of them appear negative and the more negative the better (best guess).
