The scores each footprinting algorithm output are not well documented. As such, I will have notes 
here that function as a repository for what we can find regarding the scores

It appears Wellington uses the Neph math for calculation Footprint Occupancy Score (FOS). 
It does say what is the better score, but all of them appear negative and the more 
negative the better (best guess).

--- hint score columns (pshannon, 21 sep 2016):
  score1: hint score, ranges from 2 to 10,160, mean of ~123, median 44
  score2: fimo score, -18.7 to 30.9, mean and median both about 11.5
          [what does a negative fimo score mean?]
  score3: fimo pval, min 5.9e-13, max 1e-4, mean 4.3e-5, median 4.01 e-5

--- exploration of hint & fimo scores, to replace NA with a functional numeric value
    (pshannon, 21 sep 2016)

I took 1M random scores each from wellington and hint.  Their distribution:

   fivenum(scores.hint)                 2          8         12         20     17836
   fivenum(scores.wellington)  -1000.0000   -36.8523   -18.9043   -12.9359   -10.0000

In each case, large absolute values are strong positive scores.
And therefore replacing NA with zero in each case will be interpretable as
a weak score, weaker than any actual score .
